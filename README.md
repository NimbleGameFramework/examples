# Web RPG Framework:
This framework helps you build web based rpg games. It tries to provide the tools that you will need to design and create a great game. It's meant to be a open, free alternative to tools like RPG Maker. It does not seek to be as complete or as in depth as others, however it does try to open the door for further development.

## Work to be done:
1. Document the development process on the github wiki.
2. Document the example in the github wiki
3. Create a series of videos to make the learning process easy.
4. Create example games to be featured on page
5. Improve framework website

## Features missing until 1.0 release:
1. Overlap interaction between elements.
2. Custom button interaction definition.
3. Simple smartphone controls.
4. Lock movement during animation cycle.
5. Standardize developer movement variable space

## Future features:
1. Allow binding html elements to entities (Include a video, text, or any html element in game)
1. Visual Novel engine integration.
2. RPG fighting mechanics.
3. Optimized movement iteration (If element nature still don't include in movement list)
4. Create smarter movement and interaction mechanics for entities.
5. Allow entity movement animations (Predefined paths).
6. Allow for onClick interaction with elements in the world
