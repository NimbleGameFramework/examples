# Web RPG Generator Framework:
This Framework helps you build web based rpg games. It includes several tools in order to make the development process easy and accessible. It's designed to be a open, free alternative to tools like RPG Maker. It does not seek to be as complete or as in depth as other tools, however it does try to open the door for further development.

## Work to be done:
1. I need to document the development process on the github wiki.
2. Create a series of videos to make the learning process easy.

## Future features:
1. A visual novel system to help create slide show type pages with messages as well as decision mechanics.
2. A rpg styled fighting mechanic inspired by pokemon or final fantasy.
3. Further mechanic development, a more dynamic movement system that isn't restricted to a grid.
