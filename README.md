# Web RPG Framework:
This framework helps you build web based game games. It tries to provide the tools that you will need to design and create a great game. It's meant to be a open, free alternative to tools like RPG Maker. It does not seek to be as complete or as in depth as others, however it does try to open the door for further development.

## Work to be done:
1. Document the development process on the github wiki.
2. Document the example in the github wiki
3. Create a series of videos to make the learning process easy.
4. Create example games to be featured on page
5. Improve framework website

## Features missing until 1.0 release:
1. Custom button interaction definition. (Run button, interact button, attack button, jump button, take button)
2. Simple smartphone controls. (Standardize button definition for future connection to custom buttons)
3. Lock movement during animation cycle. (unbind movement function)
4. Standardize developer movement variable space
5. Acceleration mechanic
6. Animation and movement chained array in order to store future actions (predefined paths)

## Future features:
1. Platformer mechanic alternative movement mechanic.
2. Visual Novel engine integration.
3. RPG fighting mechanics.
4. Optimized movement iteration (If element nature "still" don't include in movement list)
5. Create smarter movement and interaction mechanics for entities.
6. Allow for onClick interaction with elements in the world
